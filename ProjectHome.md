The OpenCV library gives us a greatly interesting demo for a face detection. Furthermore, it provides us programs (or functions) which they used to train classifiers for their face detection system (called HaarTraining). Thus, we can create our own object classifiers using the functions. It is interesting.

However, I could not follow how OpenCV developers performed the haartrainig for their face detection system exactly because they did not provide us several information such as what images they used for training. The objective of this report is to provide step-by-step procedures for following people.
